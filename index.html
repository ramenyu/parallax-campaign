                <h2>Why Local AI Matters</h2>
                <p>Hosting AI models locally is important for user control over the AI tooling we use everyday. With Parallax, users can stitch together consumer hardware like Apple computers and desktops with Nvidia GPUs to host large models locally. No need for expensive enterprise grade GPUs and your data is kept local and private.</p>
                <p>Applications built using this local inference endpoint are user owned. For businesses, hosting an on-prem AI solution not only cuts costs, but improves efficiencies in an AI powered system.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Reduce your cost of operations</strong> - no Inference API costs, no paid subscriptions</li>
                    <li><strong>Data inputs and outputs are private</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Ownership</strong> - You control the model version</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>More on Parallax</h2>
                <p>Parallax is the world's first fully distributed serving framework that turns a pool of heterogenous GPUs, despite their locations, into an efficient inference platform. Get complete access to the state-of-the-art open source models hosted on distributed devices collectively, for free!</p>
                <p>Deploying a large language model (LLM) inference service remains costly because centralized serving depends on specialized GPU clusters and high-bandwidth interconnects in datacenters. An appealing alternative is to leverage collaborative decentralized GPU pools. However, heterogeneity in GPU and limited interconnected network bandwidth, along with potentially dynamic availability, make efficient scheduling the central challenge in this scenario.</p>
                <p>Parallax addresses this problem with a decentralized LLM serving system that turns a pool of heterogeneous GPUs into an efficient inference platform via a two-phase scheduler. Parallax decomposes planning into (i) model allocation, which places layers of each replica across diverse GPUs to jointly optimize latency and throughput under memory and link-bandwidth constraints, and (ii) request-time GPU pipeline selection, which stitches layers from different replicas into end-to-end execution chains that balance load and adapt to current conditions.</p>
